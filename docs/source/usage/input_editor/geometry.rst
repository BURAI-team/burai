Geometry
========

The geometry window is consist of three windows, "Cell", "Elemant", and "Atoms".
The geometry window show the crystallographic information which user select.
Also, the used psudopotential is shown.

|
Cell window shows the lattice constants and lattice vectors.
if user change the lattice constants,
