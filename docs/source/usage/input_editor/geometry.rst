Geometry
========

The geometry window is consist of three windows, "Cell", "Elemant", and "Atoms".
The geometry window show the crystallographic information which user select.
Also, the used psudopotential is shown.

|
Cell window shows the lattice constants and lattice vectors.
if users change the lattice constants, users directly enter volume into the lattice constant's columns.

Elements window shows the element information of selected crystal structure.
Also, in this window, users can select the pseudopotential for each element.

Atoms window shows the atomic positions of selected crystal structure in the table.
Select the column of the table, the atom which are selected, becomes a mesh sphere.

When users enter the volume into the column, it is possible to use a numerical expression and pi in BURAI system.
